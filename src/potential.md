# Electric Potential Notes

Electric Field related to Force
$$
\vec{E} = \dfrac{\vec{F}}{q}
$$

Work done to accelerate a charge
$$
W = \int_a^b
    \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r}
$$

Electric Potential Energy:
$$
W = - \Delta U
$$

Electric Potential:
$$
V = \dfrac{U}{q}
$$

Electric Potential Difference:
(aka Voltage)
$$
\Delta V = \dfrac{\Delta U}{q}
$$
